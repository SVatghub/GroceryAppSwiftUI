# GroceryAppSwiftUI

GroceryApp is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to browse and order grocery items for delivery. The app features a clean and intuitive user interface with several views, including a welcome screen, a shop view, a cart view, and individual item views.

## Features

- **Welcome Screen**: The app greets users with a visually appealing welcome screen that introduces the app's concept and provides a "Get Started" button to navigate to the shop view.

- **Shop View**: The shop view displays a grid of available grocery items, including images, names, colors, and prices. Users can browse and add items to their cart.

- **Cart View**: The cart view shows the items added by the user, along with their quantities and total price. Users can remove items from the cart and proceed to checkout.

- **Checkout**: The app includes a placeholder for the checkout process, allowing users to complete their order and make payments (not implemented in the provided code).

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI**: The app is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern UI framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- **Swift**: The app is written in Swift, Apple's programming language for developing apps for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
